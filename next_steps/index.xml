Have tracking and enrichment set-up Have some data in the ATOMIC.EVENTS table Enabled IAB, UA parser and YAUAA enrichments Have a working dbt project with the web model configurations for the sample data Step 1: Complete refresh of your Snowplow web package (Optional) If you would like to use your current dbt environment that you set-up during modelling the sample data you might want to start from scratch.</description></item><item><title>Visualise your pipeline data</title><link>https://snowplow.github.io/advanced-analytics-web-accelerator/next_steps/next_steps_2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://snowplow.github.io/advanced-analytics-web-accelerator/next_steps/next_steps_2/</guid><description>Assuming you have already set-up your Streamlit project all you have to do is change the schema within the queries used to generate the visualisations.
Update your schema name in the queries found in queries/pageviews, queries/sessions and queries/users. For example:
SELECT count(1) AS number_of_sessions FROM NEW_SCHEMA_NAME.snowplow_web_sessions WHERE START_TSTAMP BETWEEN DATEADD(day, -7, GETDATE()) AND DATEADD(day, -1, GETDATE())</description></item><item><title>Custom models</title><link>https://snowplow.github.io/advanced-analytics-web-accelerator/next_steps/next_steps_3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://snowplow.github.io/advanced-analytics-web-accelerator/next_steps/next_steps_3/</guid><description>If you have got to this stage, congratulations!
