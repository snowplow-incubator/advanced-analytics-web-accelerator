      <description>Snowplow offers a large number of enrichments that can be used to enhance your event data. An enrichment either updates or populates fields of the atomic event or adds a self-describing context to derived_contexts.
For this project, we&amp;rsquo;ll enable the IAB, UA parser and YAUAA enrichments in your console:
The IAB enrichment requires purchase (included with Snowplow BDP)
IAB Use the IAB/ABC International Spiders and Bots List to determine whether an event was produced by a user or a robot/spider based on itsâ€™ IP address and user agent.</description>

      <description>There are a number of options to implement Snowplow tracking in your website or single page application.
Select the required pathway to implement tracking on your project.
JS React Angular Step 1: Download sp.js Add the sp.js file to your project directory. The latest version can be found here.
Step 2: Add JS snippet Add the below snippet to all of the pages you would like to track. Make sure to update the link to the sp.</description>

      <description>At this stage you should have tracking and enrichment setup as well as:
Data in the atomic.events table Enabled IAB, UA parser and YAUAA enrichments Step 1: Setup Variables Edit the dbt_project.yml which can be found at [dbt_project_name]/dbt_packages/snowplow_web/dbt_project.yml with the below options.
snowplow__start_date: The date of the first tracked event inside your atomic.events table you would like to model. snowplow__backfill_limit_days: The maximum number of days of new data to be processed since the latest event processed.</description>

      <title>Tracking Events</title>
      <link>https://snowplow-incubator.github.io/advanced-analytics-web-accelerator/tracking/tracking_2/</link>

      <description>The trackers create data on user actions at a specific point in time. For example:
Loading a web page Clicking a link Submitting a form A number of tracking events are available out of the box. These include, but aren&amp;rsquo;t limited to:
Page views Heartbeats (Page Pings) Link clicks HTML form actions Pageviews and Page Pings In this section, we will implement page views and page pings.
JS React Angular Step 1: Enable Activity Tracking First we will enable activity tracking to collect page ping events.</description>

      <title>Adding Context</title>
      <link>https://snowplow-incubator.github.io/advanced-analytics-web-accelerator/tracking/tracking_3/</link>

      <description>Whilst the tracking set up provides event data on user actions at a specific point in time, context describes the setting in which an event takes place. To describe the context of an event, we need to define and capture individual entities. For example:
The user performing an action The web page the action occured on A product that has been interacted with Together, these entities make up the context of an event.</description>

      <description>Data should now be loaded into your warehouse, next we will check the models output.
Step 1: Check the output Head to the SQL editor of your choice (e.g.: Snowflake Web UI) to check the model&amp;rsquo;s output. You should be able to see three new schemas created:
[your_custom_schema_name_]scratch: drop and recompute models that aid the incremental run [your_custom_schema_name_]derived: main output models you can use in your downstream models and reporting [your_custom_schema_name_]manifest: tables that help the integrity and core incremental logic of the model Check out the database section of the [documentation site] [snowplow-web-documentation] for a breakdown of what the output should look like.</description>

      <description>The Snowplow Chrome Extension can be used to ensure the event was emitted correctly but the browser extension does not check that the event was processed correctly.
Step 1: Installation Install the Snowplow Chrome Extension, you may need to restart your browser. Step 2: Check your data Open up devtools (F12) and navigate to the Snowplow extension. You should see a list of Pageview and Page Ping events start to form as you interact with your site.</description>
