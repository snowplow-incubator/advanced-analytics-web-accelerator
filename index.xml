      <description>There are a number of options to implement Snowplow tracking in your web app. Select the required pathway to implement tracking on your web app:
JS React Step 1: Download sp.js Add the sp.js file to your project directory. The latest version can be found here.
Step 2: Add JS snippet Add the below snippet to all of the pages you would like to track. Make sure to update the link to the sp.</description>

      <description>At this stage you should have tracking and enrichment setup as well as:
Data in the atomic.events table Enabled IAB, UA parser and YAUAA enrichments Step 1: Setup Variables Edit the dbt_project.yml which can be found at [dbt_project_name]/dbt_packages/snowplow_web/dbt_project.yml with the below options.
snowplow__start_date: The date of the first tracked event inside your atomic.events table you would like to model. snowplow__backfill_limit_days: The maximum number of days of new data to be processed since the latest event processed.</description>

      <description>The trackers create data on user actions at a specific point in time. For example:
Loading a web page Clicking a link Submitting a form A number of tracking events are available out of the box. These include, but aren&amp;rsquo;t limited to:
Page views Heartbeats (Page Pings) Link clicks HTML form actions In this section, we will implement page views and page pings.
JS React Step 1: Enable Activity Tracking First we will enable activity tracking to collect &amp;lsquo;page ping&amp;rsquo; events.</description>

      <title>Adding Context</title>

      <description>Whilst the tracking set up provides event data on user actions at a specific point in time, context describes the setting in which an event takes place. To describe the context of an event, we need to define and capture individual entities. For example:
The user performing an action The web page the action occured on A product that has been interacted with Together, these entities make up the context of an event.</description>

      <description>Data should now be loaded into your warehouse, next we will check the models output.
Step 1: Check the output Head to the SQL editor of your choice (e.g.: Snowflake Web UI) to check the model&amp;rsquo;s output. You should be able to see three new schemas created:
[your_custom_schema_name_]scratch: drop and recompute models that aid the incremental run [your_custom_schema_name_]derived: main output models you can use in your downstream models and reporting [your_custom_schema_name_]manifest: tables that help the integrity and core incremental logic of the model Check out the database section of the [documentation site] [snowplow-web-documentation] for a breakdown of what the output should look like.</description>

      <description>Test using Snowplow Mini or Micro??
The Snowplow Chrome Extension can be used to ensure the event was emitted correctly but the browser extension does not check that the event was processed correctly.
To get the full picture, tracking must be QAâ€™d using the Snowplow Mini, not just by simply checking in the browser.
Note: both events and context entities must be tested thoroughly - if a context entity that is appended to an event fails validation, the whole event will fail validation.</description>
