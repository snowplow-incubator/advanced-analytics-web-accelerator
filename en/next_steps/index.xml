      <description>Assuming you have already set-up your Streamlit project all you have to do is change the schema within the queries used to generate the visualisations.
Open pageviews.sql and sessions.sql. Change your schema name within the queries.
SELECT * FROM NEW_SCHEMA_NAME.snowplow_web_page_views SELECT * FROM NEW_SCHEMA_NAME.snowplow_web_sessions </description>
